CPE490_Lattice_Boltzmann_Project
================================

GPU accelerated D2Q9 lattice Boltzmann computational fluid dynamics. (CPE 490, Summer 2013)

Code left half-finished, but high priority for renovation.

The host code is particularly ugly. The project focus was 100% on the GPU code. 

A new method of memory tiling was developed, with mathematical proof of upper bounds of usefulness. This will be published to this github account, but not this repository, when it is finalized.
